## Project Description
A working version of a simple hangman game. 

## Purpose of the project
This game was created in response to the final capstone project of the Hyperiondev Web development bootcamp where the requirement was to build from scratch a fully working hangman game. I enjoyed working on this project a lot and so did my wife and kids who were super excited all along the development process and everytime i implemented a new feature and improved the UI!

## Installation Instructions
You can clone the repository and make a copy of it in your local machine (below are the general steps to clone a repository). You will need node to install the game dependancies and then run it using the <b>npm start</b> script step on the command terminal of your IDE to launch the game in your browser.

## Rules of the game:
<ul>
          <li>Click on any letter to start guessing the word</li>
          <li>A right guess will unveal a letter(s) </li>
          <li>
            If you manage to guess the word correctly you will receive 5 points
            upon the revelation of the last letter and the game will continue
            with the next word
          </li>
          <li>A wrong guess will start the hanging process</li>
          <li>
            With each wrong guess a part of the hangman will be drawn to the
            drawing board on the left
          </li>
          <li>
            When the hangman is fully drawn you will no loger be able to guess
            for that round and the next word will appear
          </li>
          <li>
            You will not receive any points if your hangman is fully drawn and
            you still have missing letters in the word
          </li>
          <li>If you skip/reset a word you will not get any points</li>
</ul>
